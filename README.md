b. the foundations of behaviour planning

## Please use this github properly
So that you stay in the loop as I update the repository!

- Learn to use Github: at least using ```$git clone [repo]```, ```$git add .```, ```$git commit -m "..."```, ```$git push``` and for our purposes, ```$git pull```.
- I made a video that presents this (start at the 435s mark): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAdW7aKZBac&t=435s&ab_channel=ThomasCarstens
- Star this repository for **notifications** of any changes
- Make sure to ```$git pull``` to **stay up to date** with the changes.

## Getting started with robotics on Linux
I cover the foundational techniques of Unix and ROS used to develop and debug code. As I have explored the field of robotics, I have often learned the hard way not to dive straight into things – often taking a step back can be rewarding, and even more when someone can give you the correct content – effortlessly.

This is in no ways meant to be an exhaustive list of tutorials. Instead, consider it a bibliography for fundamental concepts that you might otherwise have overlooked. They have helped me very recurringly, and please feel free to add your own.

### Unix
Unix: A beginners guide to the Unix and Linux operating system. Eight simple tutorials which cover the basics of UNIX / Linux commands.

### ROS

The ROS filesystem is fundamental to the use of c++ with modern robotics, and stumbling into development from scratch is ill-advised. Once you have done so, feel free to use the cheatsheets you can find here:
